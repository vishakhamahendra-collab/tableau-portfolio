# 🌍 Global CO₂ Emissions vs GDP vs Aging Population (65+) — Data Visualization

## 📌 Project Overview
This project visualizes the relationship between **CO₂ emissions**, **GDP**, and **the aging population (65+)** across the world from **1960 to 2023**.  
The goal is to understand how demographic transitions and economic growth correlate with environmental impact.

The dashboard is built in **Tableau** and published on **Tableau Public**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
The visualization aims to answer key global questions:

- How have CO₂ emissions evolved as countries developed economically?
- Do richer nations emit more or less CO₂ per capita?
- How does an aging population relate to economic and environmental trends?
- Which countries show strong sustainability improvements?
- How do developing vs developed regions compare over time?

## 📊 Key Features of the Dashboard

### **1. Bubble Chart: CO₂ vs GDP**
- Bubble size represents **population aged 65+ (%)**
- Color-coded by **continent / region**
- Allows comparison of development trajectories across countries

### **2. Time Slider (1960–2023)**
- Animate changes over time  
- See which countries improved emissions relative to their GDP  
- Observe aging trends globally

### **3. Filters**
- Country  
- Continent  
- Income group  
- Year  
- Emission brackets & GDP ranges  

### **4. Tooltips**
- Displays all three metrics:
  - CO₂ emissions (metric tons per capita or total)
  - GDP (current USD or PPP)
  - Percentage of population age 65+

## 🗂️ Dataset

This dashboard uses publicly available global datasets:

- **World Indicator – CO₂ emissions (EN.ATM.CO2E.PC / EN.ATM.CO2E.KT)**
- **World Indicator – GDP (NY.GDP.MKTP.CD)**
- **World Indicator – Population ages 65+ (% of total)**

The combined dataset includes:

- **Countries:** ~200  
- **Years:** 1960–2023  
- **Indicators:** 3 main metrics + geographic classifications
