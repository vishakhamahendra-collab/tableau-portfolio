📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes employee attrition using HR data to uncover patterns in workforce turnover.
The goal is to help HR teams understand why employees leave, identify high-risk groups, and support data-driven retention strategies.

The dashboard is built in Tableau and focuses on factors such as age, department, job role, experience, salary, performance rating, and work-life balance.

🎯 Objectives

The dashboard answers key HR questions:

Which employee groups have the highest attrition?

How do age, job role, and salary impact attrition?

Are certain departments or managers experiencing higher turnover?

Is overtime, job satisfaction, or work-life balance affecting churn?

What are the top drivers of attrition?
